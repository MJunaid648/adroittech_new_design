      <h2>WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h2>
      <p>
        The Website may contain third-party links which may link to other
        websites. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of the data you
        provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not
        covered by this Policy. We are not responsible for the content or
        privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,
        including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to
        or from the Website. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no
        responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
        third-party sites or services.
        <br />
        <br />
        WE HEREBY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR, ANY INFORMATION, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS,
        OR SERVICES POSTED OR OFFERED AT ANY OF THE THIRD-PARTY SITES LINKED TO
        THIS WEBSITE. BY CREATING A LINK TO A THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE, WE DO NOT

      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy unless a longer
        retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Policy will
        require us to keep your personal information for longer than the period
        in which users have an account with us. <br />
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only
        access the Website within a secure environment.

        YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION

      </h2>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU)
        and European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection
        rights, covered by GDPR and DPA. We aim to take reasonable steps to

        and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us.
        <br />
        Under certain circumstances, individuals in Europe have rights under
        data protection laws in relation to their personal data. If you are
        located in Europe, you may ask us to take the following actions
        regarding personal data that we hold:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Access:</span> You are entitled to ask us if we are processing
          your personal data and, if so, for a copy of the personal data we hold
          about you, as well as obtain certain other information about our
          processing activities.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Correction:</span> If any personal data we hold about you is
          incomplete or inaccurate, you can require us to correct it, though we

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Erasure:</span> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
          personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to
          process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
          personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to
          object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
          information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal
          data to comply with local law.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Object:</span> Where our reason for processing your personal
          data is a legitimate interest you may object to the processing as you
          feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
          the right to object where we are processing your personal data for
          direct marketing purposes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Restriction:</span> You may ask us to suspend our use of your
          personal data in the following scenarios: if you want us to establish
          the data's accuracy; where our use of your personal data is unlawful
          but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold your
          data for a longer period than we usually would, because you need it to
          establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have objected to
          our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
          legitimate grounds to use it.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Transfer:</span> Where it is possible, we will provide to you,
          or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
          commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only
          applies to personal data provided by you which you initially provided
          consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a
          contract with you.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Withdraw consent:</span> Where our reason for processing is
          based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. If
          you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
          services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time
          you withdraw your consent.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <span>Automated decision making:</span> You have the right not to be
          subject to automated decision-making (e.g., profiling) that
          significantly affects you. The exercise of this right is not available
          to you in the following cases.
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The automated decision is required to enter into, or perform, a
              contract with you.
            </li>
            <li>We have your explicit consent to make such a decision.</li>
            <li>
              The automated decision is authorised by the local law of an EU
              member state.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, in the first two cases set out above, you still have the right
        to obtain human intervention in respect of the decision, to express your
        point of view and to contest the decision. <br />
        There may be legal or other reasons why we cannot, or are not obliged
        to, fulfil a request to exercise your rights. We will use available
        lawful exemptions to your individual rights to the extent appropriate.
        If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal
        restrictions. <br />
        You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of your rights relating
        to your personal data. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
        request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we
        may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. <br />
        Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before
        responding to such requests. Please note, that we may not be able to
        provide Service without some necessary data. <br />
        You also have the right to file a complaint with the
        <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">
          supervisory authority</a
        >

        YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT
        (CCPA)/ CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT (CPRA).
      </h2>
      <p>
        “Shine the Light” and “Eraser” Laws: Residents of the State of
        California may request a list of all third parties to which we have
        disclosed certain information during the preceding year for those third
        parties' direct marketing purposes.

        <br />

        <span
          >California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act
          (CPRA):</span
        >
        The CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, provides California residents and/or
        their authorized agents with specific rights regarding the collection
        and storage of their personal information.
        <br />
        <span>Your Right to Know:</span> California residents have the right to
        request that we disclose the following information to you about our
        collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve
        (12) months. We may ask you to provide certain information to identify
        yourself so that we may compare it with our records in order to verify
        your request. Upon verification, we will disclose to you: <br />
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The categories of personal information we have collected about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          The categories of sources for the personal information we have
          collected about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our business or commercial purpose is for collecting or selling your
          personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          The categories of third parties to whom we have sold or shared your
          personal information if any, and the categories of personal
          information that we have shared with each third-party recipient.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span
          >Your Right to Opt-Out of Sale or Sharing of Personal
          Information:</span
        >
        California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of their
        personal information by submitting a request as directed on the homepage
        of our website or by contacting us using the information in the “Contact
        Us” section below. Please note that we do not knowingly sell the
        personal information of any individuals under the age of 18. <br />
        Where we are sharing your personal information with third parties for
        the purposes of cross-context behavioural advertising or profiling, you
        may opt-out of such sharing at any time by submitting a request as
        directed on the homepage of our website or by contacting us using the
        information on the “Contact Us” section below. <br /><br />
        <span>Your Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information:</span>
        California residents have the right to request that we limit our use of
        any sensitive personal information to those uses which are necessary to
        perform the Services or for other specifically enumerated business
        purposes under the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA. <br /><br />
        <span>Your Right to Delete:</span> California residents have the right
        to request that we delete any of the personal information collected from
        you and retained by us, subject to certain exceptions. We may ask you to
        provide certain information to identify yourself so that we may compare
        it with our records in order to verify your request. Once your request
        is verified and we have determined that we are required to delete the
        requested personal information in accordance with the CCPA, we will
        delete, and direct our third-party service providers to delete, your
        personal information from their records. Your request to delete personal
        information that we have collected may be denied if we conclude it is
        necessary for us to retain such personal information under one or more
        of the exceptions listed in the CCPA. <br /><br />
        <span>Your Right to Correct: </span> Under the CCPA, as amended by the
        CPRA, California residents have the right to request that we correct any
        inaccurate personal information we maintain about you, taking into
        account the nature of the personal information and the purposes for
        which we are processing such personal information. We will use
        commercially reasonable efforts to correct such inaccurate personal
        information about you. <br /><br />
        <span>Non-Discrimination:</span> You will not receive any discriminatory
        treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights conferred by the
        CCPA. <br /><br />
        <span> Verifying Your Request:</span> Only you, or a person that you
        authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your
        personal information. In the case of access and deletion, your request
        must be verifiable before we can fulfil such a request. Verifying your
        request will require you to provide sufficient information for us to
        reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected
        personal information or a person authorized to act on your behalf. We
        will only use the personal information that you have provided in a
        verifiable request in order to verify your request. We cannot respond to
        your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot
        verify your identity or authority. Please note that we may charge a
        reasonable fee or refuse to act on a request if such request is
        excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. To exercise these rights,
        please contact us at the contact information mentioned in the
        <strong>Contact Us</strong> clause.

      <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

      <p>
        <span>Google Analytics:</span> Google Analytics is a web analytics
        service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.

        Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use
        the collected data to contextualise and personalise the ads of its own
        advertising network. You can opt-out of having made your activity on the
